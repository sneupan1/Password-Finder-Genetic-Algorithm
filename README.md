# Password Finder - Genetic Algorithm

Program written in Python that uses genetic algorithm to find the password required to login to a server (set up for this particular project).

Url for the setup scenario: 
http://cs.olemiss.edu/~jones/csci343/pwd/index.php?username=spiritAnimal&password=guessedPassword

The program replaces the guessedPassword from the URL with the correct password generated using genetic algorithm. The webpage returns "SUCCESSFUL" if the password is correct. Otherwise, it returns the rejection time in milliseconds.
